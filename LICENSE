TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"You" means the licensee, or recipient of the Program.

"Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work.

"Covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

"Propagate" means any activity that, without permission, would make you directly
or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law.

"Convey" means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or
receive copies.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this
License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
from the Program, in source code form under the terms of section 4, provided that
you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving
a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this
License and any conditions added under section 7.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
comes into possession of a copy.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and
5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the
terms of this License.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
the Program. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
propagate or modify any covered work.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this
License.

11. Patents.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
of this License.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or
combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General
Public License into a single combined work.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General
Public License from time to time.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given
local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that
most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program.
